# 4500-Project The Spelunkers Cave Simulation

#### What is the Cave Simulation?
It is a school project built in Unity and designed to teach students from K-8 (split into K-2, 3-5, and 6-8) about binary trees. We needed to avoid explicitly using terms related to binary trees for earlier grade levels; our goal was to build their understanding so when students see binary trees in the future, they realize they already know something about them.

#### What should I expect from your work?
Our team of 3 had almost no experience programming in a team before we started this project. Only one of our team members had experience with Unity specifically, while another had minor experience with another game engine. There will be code that needs refactoring, whether duplicate code or parts that simply need improvements. 

For example, the root node had a root controller script which contains duplicate code from the node scripts. We could have simply attached the node script to the root node and limited the extra code we needed to write. The root controller script also has one of our names on it. The name was added before we figured out our merge issues with Unity, which improved after adding a .gitignore file. Originally the name was intended to separate 2 files and just copy the code to the old one, but the new file was included as-is. Focused on learning Unity, adding functionality, and figuing out the merge issues we never went back to change that and the script name is used in several others.

The project works, but it was a first in several ways for each of us and there was much for us to learn.

#### What can we expect in the branches?
As of 12/14/2019, the master branch contains the project files we built our final project on. The MarkQuiz branch contains the project files with additional work we did not have ready on time. While not complete or fully tested, that branch adds quizzes we intended to add based on skill level to develop students' understanding of binary trees further.
